# About the Project

This project showcases a simple art gallery front-end to demonstrate my HTML & CSS skills. It took about 2.5 hours in total to complete.

Here's the CSS skill that I tried to use in this project:

* CSS custom properties: [Custom properties (--*)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--* "CSS variables") on MDN Web Docs
* Flexbox: [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp "CSS Flexbox") on W3Schools
* Grid: [CSS Grid Layout Module](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp "CSS Grid") on W3Schools
* Breakpoints: [Typical Device Breakpoints](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_media_query_breakpoints.asp "Media Query Breakpoints") on W3Schools

## Note

- I added an extra breakpoint at 1024px for a wide tablet view to ensure the design transitions smoothly between the specified widths.
- I highly suggest considering a breakpoint at 480px for mobile devices for optimal viewing.

## Deployment

The front-end code has been deployed with GitHub Pages for a live visual representation. You can check it out [here](https://wayneinwonhan.github.io/482td/ "Live Project").
